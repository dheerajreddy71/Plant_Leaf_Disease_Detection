<h1> Plant Leaf Disease Detection

  
 # About and Why?
![Stats regarding yield loss](https://github.com/rishi2690/Plant_Leaf_Disease_Detection/blob/main/images/Stats%20regarding%20Plant%20loss.jpg)
  <br>
  <br>
 Above Image shows total crops lost due to weed, pathogen, Viruses, Animal pests etc etc. so, looking after the stats and increasing poplulation of World it's our small contribution to detect disease in plant leaf so farmers can take proper action and save even if a little amount of crops if possible.
 <br>
  <br>
  Disease-infected plants usually show obvious marks or lesions on leaves, stems, flowers, or fruits. Generally, each disease or pest condition presents a unique visible pattern that can be used to uniquely diagnose abnormalities. Usually, the leaves of plants are the primary source for identifying plant diseases, and most of the symptoms of diseases may begin to appear on the leaves.
