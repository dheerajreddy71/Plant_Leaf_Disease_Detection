 Above Image shows total crops lost due to weed, pathogen, Viruses, Animal pests etc etc. so, looking after the stats and increasing poplulation of World it's our small contribution to detect disease in plant leaf so farmers can take proper action and save even if a little amount of crops if possible.

  <br>
  Disease-infected plants usually show obvious marks or lesions on leaves, stems, flowers, or fruits. Generally, each disease or pest condition presents a unique visible pattern that can be used to uniquely diagnose abnormalities. Usually, the leaves of plants are the primary source for identifying plant diseases, and most of the symptoms of diseases may begin to appear on the leaves.

  # Database
  An image database means storing high quantities of digital images in a particular location. It also means organizing photos so that they can be shared, accessed quickly and easily. In this project we have taken large number of Different Images of crop and Leafs that is available on Internet. Various datasets are available on the internet to detect plant disease and train our model with these datasets. We can also create our own data set and train our model. But here we are thinking of using a dataset that is available on a famous site called “Kaggle”.

  # Proposed Methadology
  
 1. Collection of Data and combining various datasets. <br>
2. Labelling images of respective plant diseases <br>
3. Perform Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering and Augmentation <br>
4. Create Basic CNN for achieving baseline results<br>
5. Implement Transfer Learning Model<br><br>
6. Compare and choose the best performing model <br>
7. Test the model on Test data/Unseen data<br>
8. Record the results and provide Accuracy<br>
9. Export Model<br>
10. Deploy Webapp for Inference <br>
  
Here’s the overall architecture of the proposed methodology: <br>
